"""Cross-repo Wave-0 tests for COUNT-01 (live-bets Phase 25).

`count_vehicles_linecrossing` must emit a per-crossing ``events`` list so the
live-bets widget counter can ramp in sync with the playing clip. Each event is
``{at, class, direction, track_id}`` where ``at`` is the *video-time* of the
crossing (``frame_index / fps`` seconds, NOT wall-clock).

The contract (live-bets 25-CONTEXT.md D-11 / D-12):
- ``events`` is the per-crossing decomposition of the SAME number ``total``
  already reports, so ``len(events) == total`` BY CONSTRUCTION (one event is
  appended at the single ``_already_counted.add`` crossing site).
- ``at`` is monotonic non-decreasing in the order the crossings are observed.

These tests drive ``LineCrossingCounter`` directly (no cv2 / ultralytics), so
they run on the dev box and CI without the ``[detector]`` extras. They reuse the
crossing geometry from ``tests/test_counting.py`` (a horizontal y=100 segment
spanning x=0..200; a centroid path from above to below it crosses it once).
